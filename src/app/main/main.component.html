            Spotify allows programmers to access audio features (e.g. danceability, energy, valence, tempo) for every track.
            Unfortunately, making any use of them was too complicated for regular users. Until now.
            This app will let you generate playlists based on those features and add them to your Spotify with one click. Simple as that!
            Just connect your account and proceed to the form.
